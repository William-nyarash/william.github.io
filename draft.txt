hi, Am Waren 
a web developer


ABout 
As an artist you not olny create forms that show
 emotions but also you are required to mimic the 
reality.My desire as a web developer is to be able
 to help people from deverse backgrounds to express the 
ideas to the world without any limitations.
I do belive that through the use of the internet 
anyone and everyone can  learn, grow, and also conduct 
meaningful business that is why I seek to understand how
 I can be part of your learning journey,growth, and even 
more. In a period of three years I have been able to learn HTML, CSS and I can confidently say that I am capable of creating a functional, responsive web applications.
